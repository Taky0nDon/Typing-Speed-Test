# Typing Speed Test

Written in python and using tkinter, this is a simple graphical app for
testing your typing talent!

## Coming Features

[x] 1. Actually ending the test when time is up.
2. Allow user to set duration
3. Infinite words
4. Prevent user from altering previously typed words, or at least make sure it
doesn't break the test.

## Bug fixes needed

[] Divide by zero error when first entered char is a space
[] When restarting, typed vs target word matching does not work.


Thanks [github user david47k](https://github.com/david47k) for the list of words!
