# Typing Speed Test

Written in python and using tkinter, this is a simple graphical app for
testing your typing talent!

## How to run
`py path/to/src/main.py [test_length]`
* test length is an interger representing seconds
* default value of test_length is 60 seconds

## Coming Features

[x] 1. Actually ending the test when time is up.
2. Allow user to set duration
3. Infinite words
4. Prevent user from altering previously typed words, or at least make sure it
doesn't break the test.

## Bug fixes needed

[] Divide by zero error when first entered char is a space
[] When restarting, typed vs target word matching does not work.
